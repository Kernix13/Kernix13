I live in Springfield, Pennsylvania. I am currently studying JavaScript with the hope of landing a Front End Developer job. I have loved learning all my life and web design and development is what I have been learning the last few years. I built my first two websites in 2009 using Dreamweaver. I installed WordPress on one of those sites in 2019, and have since built two other sites using WordPress. The last website I built uses the WordPress theme that I developed using underscores as a starter template. You can check out that website at https://kernixwebdesign.com/. Also, take a look at a JavaScript-based mouse-based writing tool for people with reduced motor skills at https://kernixwebdesign.com/writer-assist.html. 

**Skills**: HTML / CSS / JS / WordPress

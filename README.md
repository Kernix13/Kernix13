### Hi Jim ðŸ‘‹

I live in Springfield, Pennsylvania. I am currently studying JavaScript with the hope of landing a Front End Developer job. I have loved learning all my life and web design and development is what I have been learning the last few years. You can check out my mouse-based writing tool for people with reduced motor skills at https://kernixwebdesign.com/writer-assist.html and the WordPRess theme I developed at https://kernixwebdesign.com/.
